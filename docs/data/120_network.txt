***PROLOGUE
<p>
The directed network widget allows interactive
exploration of directed weighted network structures.
It was developed to facilitate the exploration and comparison of gene regulatory
networks which are inferred using different methodologies.
</p>
***CODE
            
function make_network_visualization(json_spec) {
    var N = element.directed_network(json_spec);
    N.display_all();
    // preset the network to a subset view
    N.match_input.val("*stat4*");
    N.match_pattern();
    N.expand();
    N.expand();
    N.expand();
    N.relax_layout();
};
var on_load_failure = function() {
    alert("Could not load local JSON data.\n" +
            "You may need to run a web server to avoid cross origin restrictions.")
};
$.getJSON("./static/network.json", make_network_visualization).fail(on_load_failure);
***DISCUSSION
<p>
The widget allows the user to:
</p>
<dl>
<li> drag nodes of the network to new positions with the mouse,
<li> adjust the display size,
<li> find a subset of the network of interest,
<li> focus on lassoed elements or remove lassoed elements,
<li> reset the layout for the nodes of the network,
<li> display visible node and edges as text,
<li> specify a region of "too small" edge weights to exclude from view, and
<li> select nodes to display by matching names or "glob" patterns for names.
</dl>
<p>
The widget also includes a large number of configuration options which
do not have corresponding visual controls
which can be set upon initialization or modified subsequently.
</p>
<p>
The "relax" and "skeleton" layout methods use a gradient descent heuristic to find a layout
for the nodes which reflects the edge weights between connected nodes.  
These layout methods can be slow if there are a large number of nodes and edges visible.
The "wiggle" operation
applies that heuristic for a limited number of steps.
The "grid" layout just puts the nodes in a rectangular array without considering the edge weights.
