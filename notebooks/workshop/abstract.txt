An introduction to building visualizations using dual canvases

by Aaron Watters

This presentation consists of a collection of Jupyter notebooks
which introduce dual canvases and how to build interactive visualizations
with dual canvases.  The presentation will focus on using Python in
Jupyter notebooks to build visualizations (even though it is also possible to use Javascript
in other contexts).

It includes:

- A summary of background information from the Big Bang to the creation of dual canvases.
- An explanation of how to install the components needed to develop the visualizations.
- Some advanced examples to show what is possible before we dive into the grubby details.
- A walk through of dual canvas features.
- A deep dive into a few Python based visualization implementations.
