Canvases can respond to mouse events.  The mouse events can be associated to the
whole canvas or to named elements in the canvas.

In this illustration a different click event handler attaches
to each text area to change the text areas in different ways for 5 seconds.

In this illustration you may move the named objects (everything colorful)
by mousing down on the object and dragging it to a new location and then mousing up.

The <code>jp_doodle</code> package includes <code>jQuery</code> plugins to
make figures that can interact with mouse events and may be animated.
</p>
<p>
In this figure we draw a number of objects on a canvas to illustrate
basic shapes.  The figure also responds to mouse-over events.
Move the mouse over the objects to see the "name" of the object undeneith
the mouse.

        <p>
Dual canvasses provide a lasso feature which
allows the user to select a group of named elements
by encircling them with a polygonal "lasso".
</p>
<p>
In this figure the user may mouse down to draw a
polygon and mouse up to close the polygon.
Selected circles in the lassoed area will turn
from green to pink.

The <code>rectangle_collection.js</code> plugin provides
an experimental implementation of a two category bar chart.
This proof of concept is useful as an example of a complex
component built using <code>jp_doodle</code>.
</p>
<p>
Click "person type" or "State" to start and stop adjusting the
layout of the barchart.  Mouse over the rectangles and other labels
for detail information.
