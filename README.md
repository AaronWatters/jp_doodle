# `jp_doodle`

<b><code><a href="https://github.com/AaronWatters/jp_doodle">jp_doodle</a></em></code>
makes implementing special purpose interactive visualizations easy.</b>
It is designed to facilitate the development of bespoke scientific data presentation
and interactive exploration tools.

The `jp_doodle` package provides `jQuery` plugins which make it easy to build
interactive visualizations in Javascript.  The package also provides Jupyter widget
interfaces to make it easy to build visualizations for Jupyter notebooks.


# `dual_canvas`

The `dual_canvas` jQuery component of the `jp_doodle` package supports implementing
visualizations using two dimensional HTML5 canvas elements.  It provides

- Graphical object creation, deletion, mutation, and smooth feature transitions.

- Managed coordinate spaces including the pixel coordinate space, the canvas coordinate space
and reference frame coordinate spaces.

- Local and global event coordination to identify objects under positional mouse events and
relative event coordinate transformations.

- Bounding box calculation and canvas fitting support.

- Axis creation helpers.

- A built in "lasso tool" for selecting multiple objects in a canvas.

- Animation support.

The <code>jp_doodle</code> package includes <code>jQuery</code> plugins to
make figures that can interact with mouse events and may be animated.

In this figure we draw a number of objects on a canvas to illustrate
basic shapes.  The figure also responds to mouse-over events.
Move the mouse over the objects to see the "name" of the object undeneith
the mouse.

        You can draw images on canvases in two steps.
First you must load the image and identify it with a name,
and afterward you can draw the image any number of times
by providing x, y corner coordinates with width and height.
You may also specify a rectangle inside the image to draw.
